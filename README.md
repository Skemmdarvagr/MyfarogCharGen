# MyfarogCharGen

Here's the Myfarog Character Generator. It rolls 3d6 for each attribute and then asks you for the level to input.
It halves the level (as you can add one point only on even levels) and then it distributes the "points" to random attributes, 
preferring STR, CON and DEX over the others. 

It then randomizes the skills (preferring certain over others) and calculates height, weight, and stuff like that.
